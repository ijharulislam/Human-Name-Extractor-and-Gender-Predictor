This is my first repo using A.I.

I Used python natural language processing toolkit (nltk) here.

First i wrote an extractor function which takes text and using nltk it extracts human names.
After extracting names I used Sholiday gender predictor codes. Then I exported all names with gender as a csv file.

You can find sholiday gender predictor Here..
https://github.com/sholiday/genderPredictor

In sholiday repo, there was no name extractor, I added a name extractor function then used his gender predictor.
